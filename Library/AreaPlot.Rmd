# Overview

Creating a stacked area plot outlining the number of companies that were founded in a 20 year period split by gender. 

```{r AreaPlot, fig.path = '../docs/figure/'}
# Install and load packages ---------------
packages <- c(
  "tidyverse"
)

# Change to install = TRUE to install the required packages
pacman::p_load(packages, character.only = TRUE, install = FALSE)
```

# Data

This graph uses fictional data created for the purpose of this graph.

- `founded`: year a company was founded
- `n_gender`: the number of companies that were founded in that year by gender


```{r AreaPlot, fig.path = '../docs/figure/'}
# Load an example dataset ---------------
data <- read_csv("../Library/Data/gender.csv")
data <- read_csv("https://github.com/worldbank/r-econ-visual-library/tree/develop/Library/Data/gender.csv")

# Printing the first five rows of the data to visualize its structure before data wrangling
head(data)
```

```{r AreaPlot, fig.path = '../docs/figure/'}
# Creating a graph ---------------

gender_colors <- c("#F4BA3B", "#730B6D")
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = founded, y = n_gender, fill = gender)) +
  labs(x = "Year firm was founded", y = "Number of firms",
       title = "Year firm was founded, by gender of leaders") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = gender_colors, na.value = "gray") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_line()
  )
